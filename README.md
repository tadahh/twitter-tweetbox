# Sprout Social Applicant Homework

## Getting Started

-   To install dependencies run `yarn` or `npm install`
-   To run the web app and api server together, run `npm run dev`
-   To run the web app separately, run `npm run start`
    -   This may take a minute or 2 to run
-   To run api server separately, (in another terminal) run `npm run server`

## Twitter-Screenname-Server API

-   Run the twitter-screenname-server by running `npm run server`
-   The server should be running on `http://localhost:4000`
-   Navigating to `http://localhost:4000/twitter/user/search?username=chicago` should return a large JSON response.
-   To use the api, you can make a request directly to `http://localhost:4000`.
-   If port 4000 is in use, feel free to update /twitter-screenname-server/server.js source code to use a different port.

## Create-React-App

-   Create-react-app was used to set up the build process for this project. You do not need to read through the readme to work in this project.
-   The README generated by create-react-app was moved to `README-create-react-app.md`.
-   To keep the project simple and avoid any unexpected caching, the Service Worker was removed from the project.
